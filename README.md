# React-Dice PWA

This was started from the blog post at:
https://upmostly.com/tutorials/simplifying-react-state-and-the-usestate-hook


After the intial React Hooks example was coded, it was expanded to be a true PWA.

:warning: NOTE: this doesn't pass the PWABuilder.com test for pushManager.  Tried a couple reciepes in https://serviceworke.rs/ but still won't pass :(
